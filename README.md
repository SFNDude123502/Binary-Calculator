# Binary-Calculator
### A calculator that turns decimal inputs into binary, does math on them, then reverts them back to decimal.
This stems from a challenge me and my friend worked on to make a calculator that adds 2 3-bit numbers and output a 4-bit number. It escolated into this, we now have 6 operators and have made the number of allocated bits change dynamically up to the signed-int64 limit.  

To get started just download the precompiled, extensionless, file labeled "binCalc"  
Then either double click the file in downloads on windows  

Or run "sudo chmod +x \~/Downloads/binCalc" followed by "\~/Downloads/binCalc" on linux
