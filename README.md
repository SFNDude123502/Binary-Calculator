# Binary-Calculator
###A calculator that turns decimal inputs into binary, does math on them, then reverts them back to decimal.
This stems from a challenge me and my friend worked on to make a calculator that adds 2 3-bit numbers and output a 4-bit number. It escolated into this, we now have 6 operators and have made the number of allocated bits change dynamically up to the signed-int64 limit.
